 <sub><sup> Note, his is a lightweight version of https://github.com/fred144/globclustevo, which has grown to ~90G with the full repo history being ~160G. Shameful. Tried to trim it with https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo, but this tool requires rewriting the entire commit history. When pushed, no git buffer tried was big enough to rewrite it.  </sup></sub>

$TIRAMISU$ - **T**ool for **I**nvestigating **RAM**ses, making **I**t **S**imple for the **U**ser

Used to do analysis, postprocessing, and visualization for [arXiv:2212.13946](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv221213946G/abstract)

This is a lightweight version of https://github.com/fred144/globclustevo, which has grown to ~90G with the full repo history being ~160G. Shameful. 
Tried to trim it with https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo, but this tool requires rewriting the entire commit history. When pushed, no git buffer tried was big enough to rewrite it.
